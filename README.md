# Caesar-Cypher

This is a simple Caesar cypher implemented using C#

How To Use:
- Enter the plain text you want to encrypt
- Enter the key you want to use to encrypt it

Features:
- It has an decrypt option, where you insert an ecrypted string into the field for decryption, and the key that you wish to use for decryption
- It has a brute force option, where you can "hack" the encrypted text and it shows you how much time it took to decrypt
- It has a letter a frequency attack that also "hacks" the encypted code to find the closest possible match to the plain text. It uses Euclidean distance.
